# Projects Module - Comprehensive Validation Report

## 🎯 Overall Implementation Status: **100% COMPLETE**

### 📊 Module Overview

The Projects module delivers enterprise-grade project management across all submodules with full-stack coverage. All assets have been normalized under the module root following the canonical ATLVS pattern.

## ✅ Root Projects Directory

- **`page.tsx`** – Authenticates via Supabase, resolves organization context, and renders `ProjectsClient` directly (no redirects). Aligns with overview = root directive.
- **`ProjectsClient.tsx`** – Enterprise overview experience with KPI metrics, status breakdown, quick actions, custom sections, real-time refresh, demo seeding hook, and toast feedback.
- **`types.ts`** – Centralized TypeScript models for projects, tasks, files, activations, risks, inspections, locations, milestones, and DTOs.
- **`lib/projects-service.ts`** – Complete client-side service layer: filtered pagination, CRUD, bulk operations, exports, audit logging, and realtime subscriptions.
- **`drawers/`** – Create/Edit/View drawers powered by React Hook Form + Zod, reusable across views.
- **`views/`** – Specialized ATLVS-compatible view components (grid, list, kanban, calendar) with semantic tokens.
- **Documentation** – Consolidated validation report (this file) at module root.

## 📁 Submodule Implementation Status

- **`activations/`** – ✅ Client + drawers + views + service + validation report
- **`inspections/`** – ✅ Client + drawers + views + service + validation report
- **`locations/`** – ✅ Client + drawers + views + service + validation report
- **`risks/`** – ✅ Client + drawers + views + service + validation report
- **`schedule/`** – ✅ Client + drawers + views + service + validation report
- **`tasks/`** – ✅ Client + drawers + views + service + validation report

Each submodule follows the enterprise pattern: StateManager/DataViewProvider, full CRUD, filtering, bulk actions, import/export, Supabase realtime, and audit logging.

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- Authentication enforced at every entry point via Supabase server client.
- Organization membership and RBAC checks gate all data operations.
- API endpoints (`/api/v1/projects/*`) validate with Zod and audit every mutation.
- Database relies on multi-tenant RLS policies and foreign keys.

## 🔄 Real-time & Integrations

- `projects/ProjectsClient.tsx` subscribes to Supabase channels for live updates.
- Service layer exposes realtime subscription helper used across views.
- Demo seeding via `/api/organizations/[orgId]/demo` integrated into empty state.

## ⚙️ Validation Against Zero-Tolerance Criteria

- **Tab system & architecture** – Root client orchestrates metrics + ATLVS view entry points. Submodules provide DataView tabs and drawers.
- **Complete CRUD with live data** – Supabase writes + audit logs, optimistic UI, bulk ops.
- **Row Level Security** – All queries scoped by `organization_id`; RLS policies already deployed.
- **All data view types** – Grid, Kanban, Calendar, List, Timeline/Dashboard where applicable.
- **Advanced search/filter/sort** – `projects-service` filter configs, column sorting, query params.
- **Field visibility/reordering** – ATLVS `FieldConfig` usage across table/list views.
- **Import/Export** – CSV/JSON export via service layer; imports handled in drawers/forms.
- **Bulk actions** – Multi-select checkboxes, bulk update/delete handlers.
- **Drawer implementation** – `drawers/` directory with create/edit/view flows using AppDrawer/Drawer components.
- **Realtime integration** – Supabase channel subscription + router refresh triggers.
- **Routing/API wiring** – `page.tsx` entry + `/api/v1/projects` + nested endpoints for tasks, activations, etc.
- **Performance & security** – Pagination, memoization, RBAC, audit logging, semantic tokens.
- **Normalized UI/UX** – Consistent ATLVS styling, design tokens, WCAG compliance.
