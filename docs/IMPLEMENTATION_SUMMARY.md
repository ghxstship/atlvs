## ESLint Configuration

### Updated Files
- **`.eslintrc.json`** - Now includes `.eslintrc.design-tokens.js`

### What This Means
- ✅ New code is checked for violations
- ✅ Violations are reported in lint output
- ✅ Helps prevent new violations
- ⚠️ Not blocking builds yet (will be in Week 4)

### Test It
```bash
npm run lint:tokens
```

---

## Monitoring Dashboard

### Features
- ✅ Tracks violations over time
- ✅ Shows improvement metrics
- ✅ Visual progress bar
- ✅ Baseline comparison

### Usage
```bash
./scripts/monitor-design-tokens.sh
```

### Example Output
```
🔍 Running design token audit...
📊 Total violations: 414
📌 Setting baseline: 414 violations

📈 Progress Chart:

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Success
- ✅ Navigation components 100% migrated
- ✅ Theme switching works perfectly
- ✅ No visual regressions
- ✅ Violations reduced by ~20-30

### Overall Sprint Success
- ✅ 0 hardcoded hex colors in components
- ✅ 0 arbitrary color classes
- ✅ 100% design token adoption
- ✅ Perfect theme consistency
- ✅ Automated violation prevention

---

## Risk Management

### Low Risk
- ✅ Migration is mostly mechanical find-replace
- ✅ Backup system provided in scripts
- ✅ Dry-run mode for preview
- ✅ Existing design system is solid

### Manageable Risk
- ⚠️ Chart configurations may need manual testing
- ⚠️ Custom CSS may need case-by-case review
- ⚠️ Third-party components may not support tokens

### Mitigation
- Use dry-run mode extensively
- Comprehensive visual testing
- Incremental rollout by module
- Keep backups for 2 weeks

## Migration Patterns Reference

### Hardcoded Colors → Design Tokens
```tsx
// ❌ Before
className="bg-[#0039A6]"

// ✅ After
className="bg-primary"
```

### Arbitrary Classes → Semantic Classes
```tsx
// ❌ Before
className="bg-[hsl(var(--nav-bg-accent))]"

// ✅ After
className="bg-popover"
```

### Chart Colors → Token Variables
```typescript
// ❌ Before
const chartColors = {
  primary: '#0039A6',
  success: '#00933C',
}

// ✅ After
const chartColors = {
  primary: 'hsl(var(--color-primary))',
  success: 'hsl(var(--color-success))',
}
```
