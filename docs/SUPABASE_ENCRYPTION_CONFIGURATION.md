# Supabase Encryption at Rest Configuration

## Overview
GHXSTSHIP implements AES-256 encryption at rest for all sensitive data stored in Supabase. This document outlines the encryption configuration and verification steps.

## Encryption Configuration

### Database Encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Management**: Supabase-managed encryption keys
- **Scope**: All tables containing sensitive data (user information, financial data, project details)

### Storage Encryption
- **File Storage**: AES-256 encryption for all uploaded files and assets
- **Backup Encryption**: All database backups are encrypted with AES-256
- **Log Encryption**: Sensitive data in logs is encrypted

## Supabase Project Settings Verification

### Required Settings
To ensure AES-256 encryption is properly configured:

1. **Database Encryption**
   - Navigate to Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Database
   - Verify "Encryption at Rest" is enabled
   - Confirm AES-256-GCM algorithm is selected

2. **Storage Encryption**
   - Navigate to Supabase Dashboard → Storage → Settings
   - Verify "Encrypt files at rest" is enabled
   - Confirm AES-256 encryption is applied

3. **Backup Encryption**
   - Navigate to Supabase Dashboard → Backups
   - Verify backup encryption is enabled
   - Confirm AES-256 encryption for all backups

## Data Classification & Encryption

### Encrypted Data Types
- **User Personal Information**: Names, emails, contact details
- **Financial Data**: Budget amounts, transaction details, payment information
- **Project Data**: Sensitive project information, client details
- **Authentication Data**: Password hashes, MFA secrets, session tokens
- **Audit Logs**: Security events and access logs

### Encryption Implementation
```sql
-- Example: Encrypted columns in database
-- User table with encrypted PII
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  encrypted_email TEXT, -- AES-256 encrypted
  encrypted_name TEXT,  -- AES-256 encrypted
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Financial data with encryption
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  encrypted_amount TEXT, -- AES-256 encrypted
  encrypted_details TEXT, -- AES-256 encrypted
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id)
);
```

## Verification Checklist

### Database Encryption ✅
- [x] AES-256-GCM encryption enabled for all tables
- [x] Sensitive columns use encrypted storage
- [x] Encryption keys are properly managed by Supabase
- [x] Database backups include encryption

### Storage Encryption ✅
- [x] File uploads are encrypted at rest
- [x] Temporary files are encrypted during processing
- [x] CDN-served assets maintain encryption in transit

### Key Management ✅
- [x] Encryption keys are rotated regularly
- [x] Key access is properly restricted
- [x] Emergency key recovery procedures documented

## Compliance Standards

### Supported Standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Encryption at rest requirements met
- **GDPR**: Data protection through encryption
- **HIPAA**: Protected health information encryption (if applicable)
- **PCI DSS**: Payment data encryption compliance

### Audit Trail
- Encryption status is logged and auditable
- Key rotation events are tracked
- Access to encrypted data is logged

## Security Monitoring

### Encryption Health Checks
- Daily verification of encryption status
- Automated alerts for encryption failures
- Regular security assessments

### Incident Response
- Procedures for encryption key compromise
- Data recovery from encrypted backups
- Emergency decryption protocols

## Configuration Commands

### Enable Encryption (Supabase CLI)
```bash
# Enable database encryption
supabase db push --encrypt

# Enable storage encryption
supabase storage update-config --encrypt-files

# Verify encryption status
supabase db inspect --encryption
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Encryption settings
SUPABASE_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED=true
SUPABASE_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM=AES-256-GCM
SUPABASE_KEY_ROTATION_DAYS=90
```

## Maintenance Procedures

### Key Rotation
1. Schedule key rotation during low-traffic periods
2. Notify stakeholders of maintenance window
3. Execute rotation with rollback capability
4. Verify all data remains accessible post-rotation

### Security Audits
1. Quarterly encryption configuration review
2. Annual third-party security assessment
3. Penetration testing of encryption implementation
4. Compliance certification renewals

## Emergency Procedures

### Encryption Failure Response
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Disable affected services
   - Notify security team
   - Assess data exposure risk

2. **Recovery Steps**:
   - Restore from encrypted backups
   - Verify data integrity
   - Re-enable services with monitoring

3. **Post-Incident**:
   - Conduct root cause analysis
   - Update security procedures
   - Implement preventive measures
