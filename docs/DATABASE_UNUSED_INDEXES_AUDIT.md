# Database Unused Indexes Audit

**Date:** 2025-01-01  
**Status:** INFO - Review Required  
**Category:** Performance Optimization

## Overview

This document catalogs all indexes flagged as "unused" by the Supabase database linter. While these indexes have never been used in queries, they may be needed for:
- Future features
- Currently disabled modules
- Admin/reporting queries
- Edge cases or rarely-used operations

## Recommendation Strategy

1. **KEEP** - Indexes on critical foreign keys and frequently joined columns
2. **MONITOR** - Indexes that may be used by upcoming features
3. **CONSIDER REMOVAL** - Truly redundant indexes after verification

## Unused Indexes by Category

### ‚úÖ KEEP - Critical for Multi-tenant Security & Joins

These indexes support RLS policies and common join patterns:

| Table | Index | Reason to Keep |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| `products` | `idx_products_organization_id` | Critical for RLS and organization filtering |
| `projects` | `idx_projects_organization_id` | Critical for RLS and organization filtering |
| `projects` | `idx_projects_created_by` | Common for creator lookups |
| `services` | `idx_services_organization_id` | Critical for RLS and organization filtering |

## Summary & Recommendations

### ‚úÖ FINAL DECISION: KEEP ALL INDEXES

**Rationale:**
1. **Multi-tenant Security:** All `organization_id` indexes are critical for RLS policies
2. **Active Features:** All indexes support currently implemented or planned features
3. **Join Performance:** Foreign key indexes significantly improve join performance
4. **Low Storage Cost:** Index storage cost is minimal compared to query performance gains
5. **Development Stage:** Application is still evolving; premature optimization could hurt

### üìä Statistics
- **Total Unused Indexes:** 125+
- **Critical for RLS:** ~40 (32%)
- **Supporting Active Features:** ~85 (68%)
- **Recommended for Removal:** 0 (0%)

### üîÑ Monitoring Plan
1. Enable `pg_stat_statements` extension
2. Monitor index usage weekly
3. Review after 90 days of production use
4. Consider removal only if:
   - Feature permanently deprecated
   - Covered by composite index
   - Proven redundant through query analysis

### üìù Notes
- "Unused" doesn't mean "unnecessary" - many indexes support RLS, joins, and edge cases
- Storage cost of keeping indexes is minimal
- Removing indexes prematurely can cause performance issues
- Better to keep indexes during development and optimize post-production
