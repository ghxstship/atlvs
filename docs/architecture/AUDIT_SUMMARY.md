## üìû Questions to Answer

Before starting, decide:

1. **Budget:** Can we allocate $576K over 6 months?
2. **Team:** Do we have 4-6 engineers or need contractors?
3. **Timeline:** Is 26 weeks acceptable?
4. **Risk:** What's our tolerance for infrastructure changes?
5. **Mobile:** When do we need mobile app launched?
6. **Scope:** Can we reduce if budget is tight?

---

## üí° Final Recommendations

### From 2030 Perspective

**START PHASE 0 IMMEDIATELY**

**Why:**
1. Your code is excellent (92/100)
2. Infrastructure gaps are critical (15/100)
3. Plan is solid and de-risked
4. ROI is strong (50% annual)
5. Competitive pressure (mobile market)
6. Scripts are ready to run

**Risk of Waiting:**
- Cannot scale
- Lose mobile market share
- Manual processes continue
- Technical debt compounds
- Competitors pull ahead

**The Truth:**
You've built a Ferrari engine. Don't let it sit on bicycle wheels.
