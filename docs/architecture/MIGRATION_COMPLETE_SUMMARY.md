## 💡 Key Insights

### What We Learned
1. **Infrastructure-first was correct** - Solid foundation established
2. **Zero-tolerance audit was essential** - Revealed true completion state
3. **Documentation is critical** - Comprehensive guides enable future work
4. **Phases 2 & 3 are the most critical** - Domain and application layers are foundation

### What Surprised Us
1. **Phase 1 was only 64% complete** - More work remaining than expected
2. **Templates were completely missing** - Critical gap in UI layer
3. **Weighted progress is only 42.8%** - Much lower than simple percentage
4. **Phases 2 & 3 not started** - Biggest gap in migration

### What We'd Do Differently
1. **Start with domain layer** - Foundation should come first
2. **Better progress tracking** - Need more granular metrics
3. **Write tests alongside** - Test-driven migration
4. **More realistic estimates** - Account for architectural complexity
