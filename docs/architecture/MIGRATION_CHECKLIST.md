2. **Performance Regression** - Performance monitoring and budgets
3. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Regular security audits
4. **Data Loss** - Backup and rollback procedures

### Mitigation Strategies
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Monitoring and alerting
- Rollback procedures documented
- Regular backups

- Week 8-10: Testing and production deployment

---

## Notes

### Key Decisions
1. **Adapter Pattern** - All infrastructure services use adapter pattern
2. **Mock Implementations** - Provide mock implementations for development
3. **TypeScript Strict** - Enable strict mode for type safety
4. **Interface-First** - Define interfaces before implementations

### Open Questions
1. Service registry implementation approach?
2. Circuit breaker library selection?
3. API gateway requirements?
4. Caching strategy details?

### Action Items
1. Schedule integration testing for Phase 4 services
2. Set up DI container for service wiring
3. Configure environment variables for all services
4. Create health check endpoints
