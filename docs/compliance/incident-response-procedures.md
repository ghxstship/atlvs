3. **Team Notification**: Alert incident response team
4. **Evidence Preservation**: Secure logs and system state
5. **Containment Planning**: Identify immediate containment options

## 🔄 Incident Response Phases

### Phase 1: Identification (0-30 minutes)

#### Incident Declaration
```typescript
interface IncidentDeclaration {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  severity: IncidentSeverity;
  category: IncidentCategory;
  reportedBy: string;
  reportedAt: Date;
  initialAssessment: string;
  affectedSystems: string[];
  potentialImpact: ImpactAssessment;
}
```

#### Initial Assessment
- **Scope Determination**: Identify affected systems and data
- **Impact Evaluation**: Assess business and security impact
- **Containment Urgency**: Determine immediate action requirements
- **Resource Requirements**: Identify needed team members and tools

#### Team Activation
- Notify incident response team based on severity
- Establish command center (physical or virtual)
- Assign roles and responsibilities
- Set up communication channels

### Phase 2: Containment (30 minutes - 2 hours)

#### Short-term Containment
1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   ```bash
   # Network isolation
   iptables -A INPUT -s $ATTACKER_IP -j DROP

   # Service shutdown (if necessary)
   systemctl stop affected-service

   # Access revocation
   revoke-user-access compromised-user
   ```

2. **Evidence Collection**
   ```bash
   # Memory capture
   volatility -f memory.dump --profile=Win7SP1x64 pslist

   # Log preservation
   cp /var/log/auth.log /evidence/auth.log.backup
   sha256sum /evidence/auth.log.backup > /evidence/auth.log.sha256

   # Network traffic capture
   tcpdump -i eth0 -w /evidence/traffic.pcap
   ```

3. **Damage Assessment**
   - Identify compromised systems
   - Assess data exposure
   - Evaluate persistence mechanisms
   - Determine attacker access level

#### Containment Validation
- Verify containment effectiveness
- Monitor for additional indicators
- Implement additional controls if needed
- Prepare for eradication phase

### Phase 3: Eradication (2-8 hours)

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Technical Investigation**
   - Analyze attack vectors
   - Identify vulnerabilities exploited
   - Determine attacker methods and tools
   - Assess dwell time and lateral movement

2. **System Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Malware removal
   clamscan -r --remove /  # Comprehensive scan
   find / -name "*malware*" -delete  # Known malware files

   # System hardening
   apt update && apt upgrade  # Security patches
   passwd -l compromised-user  # Lock accounts

   # Configuration reset
   cp /etc/backup/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   systemctl restart sshd
   ```

3. **Vulnerability Remediation**
   - Patch exploited vulnerabilities
   - Update security configurations
   - Implement additional security controls
   - Verify system integrity

### Phase 4: Recovery (8-24 hours)

#### System Restoration
1. **Clean System Deployment**
   ```bash
   # From backup restoration
   restore-from-backup --clean-backup pre-incident-backup

   # Configuration validation
   validate-configuration --against-baseline

   # Service testing
   test-service-availability affected-service
   ```

2. **Gradual Service Restoration**
   - Start with non-critical systems
   - Monitor for anomalies
   - Gradually increase load
   - Validate functionality

3. **User Communication**
   - Notify affected users of restoration
   - Provide status updates
   - Communicate security recommendations

### Phase 5: Lessons Learned (1-2 weeks)

#### Post-Incident Review
1. **Timeline Reconstruction**
   - Document all events chronologically
   - Identify detection and response gaps
   - Validate effectiveness of procedures

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   ```typescript
   interface RootCauseAnalysis {
     incidentId: string;
     primaryCause: string;
     contributingFactors: string[];
     preventionMeasures: string[];
     detectionImprovements: string[];
     responseEnhancements: string[];
   }
   ```

3. **Process Improvement**
   - Update incident response procedures
   - Enhance detection capabilities
   - Implement preventive measures
   - Update training materials

#### Final Report
