## üîê Access Control

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

#### User Lifecycle Management
```typescript
enum UserLifecycleStage {
  PROVISIONING = 'provisioning',     // Account creation and setup
  ACTIVE = 'active',                 // Normal operation
  SUSPENDED = 'suspended',           // Temporary access restriction
  TERMINATED = 'terminated'          // Account deactivation
}
```

#### Authentication Methods
- **Primary**: Email and password with complexity requirements
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all users
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: SAML 2.0 and OIDC support
- **Biometric Authentication**: Mobile app support
- **Hardware Security Keys**: FIDO2/WebAuthn support

#### Password Policy
```typescript
interface PasswordPolicy {
  minLength: number;        // 12 characters minimum
  maxAge: number;           // 90 days maximum
  complexity: {
    uppercase: boolean;     // Required
    lowercase: boolean;     // Required
    numbers: boolean;       // Required
    symbols: boolean;       // Required
  };
  history: number;          // Prevent reuse of last 10 passwords
  lockout: {
    attempts: number;       // 5 failed attempts
    duration: number;       // 30 minutes lockout
  };
}
```

### Authorization Framework

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```typescript
interface RolePermissions {
  owner: {
    users: ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete'],
    organizations: ['manage'],
    billing: ['manage'],
    system: ['admin']
  };
  admin: {
    users: ['create', 'read', 'update'],
    organizations: ['read', 'update'],
    security: ['manage']
  };
  manager: {
    projects: ['create', 'read', 'update'],
    team: ['manage'],
    reports: ['read', 'export']
  };
  member: {
    projects: ['read', 'update'],
    tasks: ['create', 'read', 'update'],
    expenses: ['create', 'read']
  };
  viewer: {
    projects: ['read'],
    reports: ['read']
  };
}
```

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- **Context-Aware**: Time-based, location-based, device-based
- **Business Rules**: Project ownership, department membership
- **Dynamic Permissions**: Temporary access grants

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection

### Data Classification

#### Classification Levels
```typescript
enum DataClassification {
  PUBLIC = 'public',        // No restrictions
  INTERNAL = 'internal',    // Company confidential
  CONFIDENTIAL = 'confidential', // Customer data, financial info
  RESTRICTED = 'restricted' // Highly sensitive, PII, secrets
}
```

#### Classification Guidelines
- **Public**: Marketing materials, public documentation
- **Internal**: Internal processes, non-sensitive business data
- **Confidential**: Customer PII, financial records, contracts
- **Restricted**: API keys, encryption keys, security credentials

### Encryption Standards

#### Data at Rest
- **Database**: AES-256 encryption for all sensitive fields
- **File Storage**: Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys
- **Backups**: Encrypted backups with secure key management
- **Logs**: Sensitive data redaction in application logs

#### Data in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: Minimum TLS version for all communications
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate rotation
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled
- **API Security**: JWT tokens with secure signing

### Data Retention and Disposal

#### Retention Policies
```typescript
interface RetentionPolicy {
  dataType: string;
  classification: DataClassification;
  retentionPeriod: {
    active: number;     // Days to retain active data
    archived: number;   // Days to retain archived data
  };
  disposalMethod: 'delete' | 'anonymize' | 'archive';
  legalHold: boolean;
}
```

#### Disposal Procedures
- **Secure Deletion**: Cryptographic erasure for sensitive data
- **Anonymization**: PII removal for analytics retention
- **Archival**: Long-term storage for compliance requirements
- **Verification**: Disposal confirmation and audit logging

## üîç Security Monitoring
