  <div role="alert" className="error-state">
    <h2>Something went wrong</h2>
    <button onClick={resetError} className="retry-button">
      Try again
    </button>
  </div>
);

// Example: Loading state management
const LoadingState = ({ variant = 'skeleton' }) =>
  variant === 'skeleton' ? <SkeletonLoader /> : <SpinnerLoader />;
```

#### Strengths
- ✅ Comprehensive error state designs
- ✅ Loading state consistency across components
- ✅ Form validation with accessibility feedback
